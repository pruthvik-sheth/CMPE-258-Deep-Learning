# AI Transfer Learning & Foundation Models Demonstration

This repository contains a comprehensive demonstration of transfer learning techniques and foundation models across multiple modalities, including vision, audio, and generative tasks. The project showcases how pretrained models can be leveraged for various applications with minimal additional training.

## Overview

The Jupyter notebook in this repository demonstrates 10 different transfer learning and model fine-tuning approaches:

1. **Pose Detection**: Using MoveNet model to detect human pose keypoints
2. **Crop Disease Detection**: Fine-tuning MobileNetV2 for plant disease classification
3. **Video Classification**: Transfer learning with MovieNet for video content analysis
4. **Sound Classification**: Using YAMNet for audio event recognition
5. **Audio Recognition**: Speech command recognition system using synthetic data
6. **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**: Powerful image segmentation capabilities
7. **Transformers Models**: Text generation, NER, sentiment analysis, and more
8. **DeepFloyd IF/Stable Diffusion**: Text-to-image generation capabilities
9. **Image-to-Image & Inpainting**: Image editing and manipulation techniques
10. **DreamBooth**: Personalizing text-to-image models with specific subjects
