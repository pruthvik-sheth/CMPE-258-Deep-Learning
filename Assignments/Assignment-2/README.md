# Deep Learning Models Assignment

This repository contains implementations of three deep learning models for classification, regression, and image classification tasks, along with comprehensive analysis and metrics evaluation.

## Task Details

### 1. Classification Model

- Implementation in Google Colab with full model architecture diagram
- Integration with Weights & Biases (or TensorFlow TensorBoard)
- Video walkthrough: [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/J2ilkDsimb4)
- Colab: [Colab Link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pruthvik-sheth/CMPE-258-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Assignments/Assignment-2/classification/IRIS_Classification.ipynb)
- Metrics:
  - Overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
  - Per-class accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
  - ROC and PR curves
  - Class examples visualization
  - Detailed error analysis per class
