# Deep Learning Models Assignment

This repository contains implementations of three deep learning models for classification, regression, and image classification tasks, along with comprehensive analysis and metrics evaluation.

## Task Details

### 1. Classification Model

- Implementation in Google Colab with full model architecture diagram
- Integration with Weights & Biases (or TensorFlow TensorBoard)
- Video walkthrough: [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/classification-model-walkthrough)
- Metrics:
  - Overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
  - Per-class accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
  - ROC and PR curves
  - Class examples visualization
  - Detailed error analysis per class

### 2. Regression Model

- Implementation in Google Colab with full model architecture diagram
- Integration with Weights & Biases (or TensorFlow TensorBoard)
- Video walkthrough: [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/regression-model-walkthrough)
- Metrics:
  - MSE, MAE, RMSE
  - Residual plots
  - Prediction vs. Actual visualization
  - Error distribution analysis
  - Feature importance analysis

### 3. Image Classification Model

- Implementation in Google Colab with full model architecture diagram
- Integration with Weights & Biases (or TensorFlow TensorBoard)
- Video walkthrough: [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/image-classification-walkthrough)
- Metrics:
  - Overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
  - Per-class accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
  - ROC and PR curves
  - Class examples visualization
  - Misclassified examples analysis
