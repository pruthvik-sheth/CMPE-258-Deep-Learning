# Machine Learning Demonstration Projects

This repository contains two main projects demonstrating various machine learning applications:

## Part A: Teachable Machine Demos

Three examples using Google's Teachable Machine framework:

1. **Image Classification**: Train a model to recognize different objects or categories from images
2. **Audio Recognition**: Create a system that can identify various sounds or spoken commands
3. **Pose Detection**: Develop an application that recognizes different body poses or gestures

## Part B: Keras Hub Implementations

Variations of TensorFlow Hub examples with increasing complexity levels:

1. **Easy**: Simple image classification using pre-trained models
2. **Intermediate**: Text classification for sentiment analysis
3. **Advanced**: Image segmentation techniques
4. **Expert**: Transfer learning for specialized domain adaptation

## Video Demonstrations

All projects include comprehensive video walkthroughs that explain:

- Project setup and requirements
- Implementation details
- Training process
- Evaluation of results
- Potential applications and extensions
